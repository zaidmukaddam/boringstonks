Being productive is more than getting work done. Being productive is using our time to its greatest potential. By increasing our productivity we increase the return we get relative to the amount of effort we put in.

To ensure we stay on target and are always being as productive as possible we may need help. So, in this post, I've compiled three of my favourite apps to boost productivity.

---

## Todoist

Todoist is an unrivalled to-do list app (at least in my opinion). I've tried a lot of different ways to keep track of my tasks and to-do lists, but none of them have come close to Todoist.

I tried using a pen and paper, but I never had it with me, so I missed tasks, which resulted in lower productivity.

I then tried transferring my task lists to Notion, another of my favourite apps. However, I discovered that while Notion is useful for a variety of tasks, it isn't one of them. Overall, I found Notion to be too slow to be used as a task list.

These problems do not exist in Todoist. It's always on my phone, and it's quick, so I can add tasks as they come to mind. Todoist's UI/UX is designed to make task management a breeze because it's sole purpose is to be a to-do list app.

I imagine I will be using Todoist for a long time. If you're interested in trying it out, you can [check it out here.](https://todoist.com/)

## Notion

While I previously stated that Notion is not ideal for organizing to-do lists, it is ideal for other tasks. Notion has you covered if you need to keep track of projects, content development, or anything else that isn't a basic list.

I keep track of all my stuff and projects with Notion. If I get an idea for a blog post, I add it to Notion right away. I use a Kanban board to move all of the posts from concept to completion once they're in Notion. This is something I do with projects and other forms of information as well.

Notion may be used for nearly anything, which is part of what makes it appealing. I won't cover all its features here but I recommend [checking it out.](notion.so/)

## Forest

The last app on this list is not a to-do list or a means to organise your projects and life.

Instead, it's a method of ensuring that you stay focused and on subject for a set period of time. It pushes you to be more productive.

Forest is a fantastic software that I've been using for several years. It facilitates the usage of the Pomodoro technique. If you haven't heard of it, it's a productivity approach that involves working in small sprints followed by rests. The typical time frame is 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minutes of rest. This is repeated two-thirds of the way through before taking a lengthier break, such as 15 minutes.

Forest, on the other hand, goes a step farther. It's not a timer like you'd find on a smartphone. No, it prevents you from using your phone. If you try to launch another programme, it will close the one you are now using and return you to Forest until the countdown expires. Don't believe you're slacking any longer!

In addition, if you upgrade to the pro version, they will plant trees to help save forests! [Check it out here.](https://www.forestapp.cc/)

## How I use these apps

While having these three apps on your phone or computer is beneficial, it is insufficient. What we need to do is optimise them and how we use them in order to increase productivity.

Here's a quick rundown of how I employ these tools in my workflow.

Every morning, I browse through my Todoist tasks to see which ones have been accomplished. Then I add any jobs that are logically the following step.

For example, if I had a task to write a blog post, I would make a new task to edit it once I finished it.

This isn't possible for all tasks because you never know what's going to happen next. But, wherever possible, I make a point of including the following assignment. The less I think about it, the better, because our minds are lousy file cabinets.

As a general, I avoid using due dates unless they are absolutely necessary. For example, if I had a task to take the car in for service, I wouldn't be able to complete it until the service date. The task will be scheduled for the service date in this situation. However, because altering a post can be done whenever it is convenient, I will include it with no due date and instead use a priority.

Priorities enable me to see all of my chores in a single list, sorted by priority. Then I prioritise the highest priority, which should produce the largest profits.

Once Todoist has been updated, I will begin updating and reviewing Notion.

As previously stated, I use Notion for my projects and material, so it's really easy to edit. First, I double-check that all of my content and projects are in the correct state. Then I check to see if there are any new tasks I can add to Todoist as a result of status changes. So, if a post is in the writing stage, do I have to write it? Or, if I just finished it, do I need to update it?

It may appear like managing the two apps is a lot of work. However, if you've established a routine and a rhythm, you'll discover that you just check Notion once per day and manage your life using Todoist.

Finally, I don't have a certain time when I utilise Forest. Instead, I utilise it when a task requires my undivided focus. I don't use it for every task, but for the ones that do, it's fantastic.

## Summing Up

These are the apps I'm now using in my never-ending quest for better productivity. Now, I'm not going to claim that my approach or these apps are great for everyone. The system you use, not the programmes you utilise, is more significant.

However, in the process of increasing productivity, we learn a lot about ourselves and how we work best. Building a system around this is what I advocate because it will result in the most productivity gains.
