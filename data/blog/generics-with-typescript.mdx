In this fast tutorial, we'll define generics and show you how to utilise them with TypeScript. It solves a query I received from a friend, and I thought it could be valuable to others as well. We'll go through the following topics:

- What are generics
- Using generic types
- Generics constraints
- Generics with functions~

If you're comfortable with the idea of code reuse, this is exactly what you're looking for. We can utilise generics to generate reusable type patterns. It produces flexible types that function with multiple variants, as well as fewer types to maintain because duplication is avoided.

Code reuse is a key aspect of creating flexible components/functions that service complicated and massive systems. Nonetheless, abstraction is difficult to master in general and, in some circumstances, can lead to inflexibility.

## What are generics

You may think of generics as arguments to your types. When a type containing generics is used, the generics are passed to it. As previously said, this will allow us to reuse the type declaration's common patterns.

Many functions that you're already using could have optional generic types. For example the array methods like `Array.map()` and `Array.reduc()` accept a generic for elements type:

```ts {1-3}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers.map((n) => n)
numbers.map<number>((n) => n) // with a generic <number> type
```

You probably also came across generics while fixing Typescript type errors, without knowing what's going on. We've all been there. Once you learn about generics, you'll see them used everywhere, in the web APIs and third-party libraries.

Hope that by the end of this post it'll be more clear to you.

## Generic types

We can start by building our first type with generics. Let's say you have two functions `getUser` and `getProduct` that return some data for a user and a product:

```ts {1-18}
type User = {
  email: string
}

type Product = {
  id: string
}

type UserResponse = {
  data: User
}

type ProductResponse = {
  data: Product
}

const user: UserResponse = getUser(id)
const product: ProductResponse = getProduct(id)
```

You'll notice that the `UserResponse` and `ProductResponse` are kind of the same type declaration, both have `data` key but with different types. You can expect that if a new type is added it will also need to have its own `YetAnotherResponse` type which will result in duplicating same response type over and over again. And in the case you want to make a change across `...Responses` types, good luck with that.

We can abstract this common pattern, so our `Response` will be a generic type and depending on the `Data` type passed, it will give the corresponding `Response` type.

```ts {1-14}
type User = {
  email: string
}

type Product = {
  id: string
}

type GenericResponse<Data> = {
  data: Data
}

const user: GenericResponse<User> = getUser(id)
const product: GenericResponse<Product> = getProduct(id)
```

## Generics constraints

You might notice that so far the generic type accepts any type. That could be what you need, but sometimes we would want to limit or add constraints to a certain type for the generic type passed.

For a simple example, we can have an `Input` type that has a `Value` generic type. If we want to constrain the `Value` generic type possibilities to be only a `string` or a `number` type, we can specify that by adding an `extends` keyword after the generic name, then the specific constraints type:

```ts {1-5}
type Input<Value extends string | number> = Value

const input: Input<string> = 'text' // works
const input: Input<number> = 123456 // works
const input: Input<object> = {} // has error
```

## Generics with functions

Generics are part of type definitions. You just need to know how to annotate functions whether it's a function declaration or an arrow function expression:

```ts {1-7}
function getInput<Input>(input: Input): Input {
  return input
}

const getInput = <Input>(input: Input): Input => {
  return input
}
```

## Additional example ‚åÅ

A few months back I wrote an over simplified version of React Query's `useQuery` hook to replace `useEffect` for data fetching in React. Here you'll find a generic `Query` type:

<Tab initialTab={1}>
  <Tab.Item title="snippet">

```ts {1-13}
type Query<Data> = {
  loading: boolean
  error: boolean
  data: Data
}

type Key = string | string[]
type Fetcher<Data> = () => Promise<Data>
type Options = { enabled?: boolean; cacheTime?: number }

const useQuery = <Data>(key: Key, fetcher: Fetcher<Data>, options?: Options): Query<Data> => {
  // ...
}
```
  </Tab.Item>
  <Tab.Item title="complete">

```ts {1-36}
import { useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState } from 'react'

export type Query<T> = { loading: boolean; error: boolean; data?: T }
type Options = { enabled?: boolean; cacheTime?: number }

const defaultOptions: Options = { enabled: true, cacheTime: 0 }

const cache = new Map<string, unknown>()

export const useQuery = <T>(key: string | string[], fetcher: () => Promise<T>, options?: Options): Query<T> => {
  const ref = useRef<() => Promise<T>>()

  const [status, setStatus] = useState<'stale' | 'loading' | 'error' | 'done'>('stale')
  const [data, setData] = useState<T>()

  const id = useMemo(() => (typeof key === 'string' ? key : key.join('/')), [key])
  const { enabled, cacheTime } = { ...defaultOptions, ...options }

  ref.current = fetcher

  useEffect(() => {
    if (enabled) {
      if (cacheTime === Infinity && cache.has(id)) {
        setData(cache.get(id) as T)
      } else {
        setStatus('loading')
        ref
          .current?.()
          .then((data) => (setData(data), setStatus('done'), cache.set(id, data)))
          .catch(() => setStatus('error'))
      }
    }
  }, [id, enabled, cacheTime])

  return { loading: status === 'loading', error: status === 'error', data }
}
```
  </Tab.Item>
</Tab>

You can find the entire version of this simplified `useQuery` hook on the `complete` tab of the above snippets if you want to take a look on the entire implementation.

## What's next

Hope that explained what are generics and how to start using them with TypeScript. You can find more details and examples at [TypeScript generics docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html).

There are very useful [TypeScript utility types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html), that you'll use generics with. I highly recommend you to check them out, it will help you a lot while using TypeScript in general.

I would love to hear what you think about this post, feel free to leave a comment on the discussion. If you have questions or got stuck at some point I'll be happy to help.
