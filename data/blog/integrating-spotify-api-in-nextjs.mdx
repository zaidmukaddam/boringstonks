Hhhmmm... Spotify.. I like the **Discover Weekly** the most, because the recommendations are based on the music we often play, so there's a lot of music that fits our ears.

On Spotify there is also a **Friend activity** feature, we can see what music our friends are listening to. Because I <s>don't have friends</s> like to share, so I created a Spotify playback status widget in Next.js, who knows if visitors to this website have a taste in music like me,... weirdo.

<Text
  as="p"
  size={{ '@initial': 'xs', '@sm': 'sm' }}
  css={{ opacity: 0.5 }}
  children={
    <em>
      NB: The widget is already installed in the footer of this website, scroll down to the poll.
    </em>
  }
/>

This article only covers the Spotify API integration, I will write about the React component on another occasion.

## Authorization

There are several flows that we can use, because we will use the API **not** from the client but from the Next.js server side, we use the [Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/code-flow/).
The reason is because we can store the `refresh_token` safely without being exposed to the client. We will hit the endpoint of Vercel's serverless.

Before doing the flow we are required to have a [Spotify App](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/)

### Create a Spotify App

- Visit [Dashboard Developer Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
- Create a new App, click "Create An App"
- In the newly created App page click "Edit Settings"
- Fill in "Redirect URIs" with the local development address, for example `http://localhost:3000/callback`
- Save _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ to Env Next.js

### Getting the `Authorization code`

Please open the following URI in a browser:

```uri {1}
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=user-read-currently-playing&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI
```

<Text
  as="p"
  size={{ '@initial': 'xs', '@sm': 'sm' }}
  css={{ opacity: 0.5 }}
  children={
    <em>
      *Adjust CLIENT_ID and REDIRECT_URI with yours, for full scope see{' '}
      <a
        href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
      >
        here
      </a>
    </em>
  }
/>

Once authenticated the browser will redirect with the query `code`:

```uri {1}
REDIRECT_URI?code=AQC5peqvEd-xxx
```

We will use the authorization `code` to get the `refresh_token`.

### Getting `refresh_token`

We will need a `basic_token` which is base64 with the format _CLIENT_ID_:_CLIENT_SECRET_.

#### Basic Token

You can use tools like [base64encode.org](https://www.base64encode.org/), or you can use the command below:

<Tab>
  <Tab.Item title="shell">

```bash {1}
BASIC_TOKEN=$(echo "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" | base64)
```

  </Tab.Item>
  <Tab.Item title="javascript">

```js {1}
const basicToken = Buffer.from(`${clientId}:${clientSecret}`).toString('base64')
```

  </Tab.Item>
</Tab>

#### Refresh Token

Make a POST Request to the URI `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token`:

<Tab initialTab={1}>
  <Tab.Item title="curl">

```bash {1-4}
curl -X POST "https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token" \
     -H "Content-Type" "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -H "Authorization" "Basic $BASIC_TOKEN" \
     -d "grant_type=authorization_code&code=$CODE&redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URI"
```

  </Tab.Item>
  <Tab.Item title="javascript">

```js {1-20}
const response = await fetch('https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    Authorization: 'Basic ' + basicToken
  },
  body: new URLSearchParams({
    grant_type: 'authorization_code',
    code: code,
    redirect_uri: redirectUri
  }).toString()
})

console.log(response.json())
```

  </Tab.Item>
</Tab>
<Text
  as="p"
  size={{ '@initial': 'xs', '@sm': 'sm' }}
  css={{ opacity: 0.5 }}
  children={<em>*Adjust the variables with your own</em>}
/>

We will get response containing `access_token` and `refresh_token`, please save only `refresh_token` to Env of the Next.js application

## Creating an API in Next.js

Because our API will run on a serverless platform, we cannot save the `access_token` that we got in the previous request, so every time there is a request to the Next.js API we have to get a new `access_token` to then request data to the Spotify API.

#### Getting `access_token`

```js {1-26}
const clientId = process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
const clientSecret = process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
const refreshToken = process.env.SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN || ''

const basicToken = Buffer.from(`${clientId}:${clientSecret}`).toString('base64')

const getAccessToken = async () => {
  const url = 'https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token'
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    Authorization: 'Basic ' + basicToken
  }

  const formData = new URLSearchParams({
    grant_type: 'refresh_token',
    refresh_token: refreshToken
  })

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData.toString(),
    headers
  })

  return response.json()
}
```

#### Get Spotify Playback Status

```js {1-12}
const getCurrentlyPlaying = async () => {
  const { access_token } = await getAccessToken()
  const url = 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/currently-playing'
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: 'Bearer ' + access_token
  }

  const response = await fetch(url, { headers })

  return response.status === 200 ? response.json() : null
}
```

### Endpoint Next.js

Please adjust it to your frontend needs

```js {3-21}
// pages/api/now-playing.js

import { getCurrentlyPlaying } from '~/lib/spotify'

export default async (req, res) => {
  const music = await getCurrentlyPlaying()

  // If no music is playing
  if (!music || !music.item || !music.is_playing) {
    return res.status(200).json({ isPlaying: false })
  }

  // please adjust your frontend needs
  res.status(200).json({
    isPlaying: true,
    title: music.item.name,
    artists: music.item.artists.map(({ name }: any) => name).join(', '),
    spotifyUrl: music.item.external_urls.spotify,
    cover: music.item.album.images.find(({ height }: any) => height === 64)?.url
  })
}
```

## Conclusion

With Next.js we can easily integrate into any platform because of its serverless platform and features of its API pages.

It seems that the goal of this article has been achieved, I will write about the React component at a later time. If anyone is curious, I open the source of this website in [my github repository](https://github.com/zaidmukaddam/boringstonks/).

Thank you.
